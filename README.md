**STEPS FOR MAKING A CLEAN CLONE.**
1. Install Git if you don't have it already.

   Link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   
2. In your command prompt (i.e. Git Bash), use the cd command to travel to the path where you want to clone the repo.

   Ex. cd C:\xampp\htdocs\MyMoodle\mod

3. Clone the repository using the ssh key found in the green code dropdown.

   Ex. git clone PASTE-REPO-SSH-KEY-HERE
   
4. Go inside the repo file using cd
   
5. Create your branch
   
   Ex. git checkout -b jtd5597/first_branch

6. Pull

      Ex. git pull

**STEPS FOR INITIALIZING THE REPO IN YOUR PROJECT FILE IF YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE WORK**

1. Navigate to your project directory using cd command.

2. Initialize git repo

   Ex. git init

4. Add git repo as a remote

   Ex. git remote add origin PASTE-REPO-SSH-KEY-HERE

5. Make your branch and make sure you're switched into it.

   Ex. git checkout -b branch-name

6. Pull the main branch

   Ex. git pull origin main

8. Add your files

   Ex. git add .

   The "." uploads all files. However, git won't add the files that haven't been changed from whatever you're pushing to.

9. Commit your changes

   Ex. git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

10. Push to the repo

    Ex. git push -u origin jtd5597/first_branch
